                <h1>How it works</h1>
                <p> Our card details are randomly generated using the Luhn
                    (MOD 10) algorithm. All real credit cards follow this
                    algorithm, they have fixed prefixes and can be easily
                    identified (i.e VISA cards always start with a '4'). If you
                    want to learn more about how the Luhn checksum
                    formula works then check out an indepth breakdown. To
                    try our tool, simply Create your account for free, select a 
                    credit card design of your choose, generate your card 
                    code and download your card to your user accout.</p>
